# Assignment2A-with_MediaQueries
 This is Assignment-2a - Add media queries to the previous Basic Portfolio assignment to make it a responsive website to 
 change the layout based on the screen of the devices.

I have added a break point in my assignment from desktop to a phone and vice versa.

This is a responsive website fits well with Phone and Desktop.
